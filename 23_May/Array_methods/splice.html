<script>
      const fruits=["Apple","Banana","Orange","Grape","Papaya",'Dates',"Watermelon"]

    //   const result = fruits.splice(2,3)
      //it will remove element from index 2 which is Orange. And second value in splice() method counts how many of elements you want to remove from array.


      const result1=fruits.splice(2,3,"groot","groot","groot") //this will remove elements and replace by groot

      //splice() method effects on array but slice() method does not effects on array
